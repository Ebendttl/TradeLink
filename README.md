TradeLink: Decentralized Marketplace Protocol
========================================

Overview
--------

This smart contract implements a sophisticated decentralized marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain, providing a secure, transparent, and feature-rich platform for buying and selling digital items.

Key Features
------------

### 1\. Item Management

-   Add new items to the marketplace
-   Update item prices
-   Remove items from listing
-   Support for multiple item categories
-   Detailed item metadata (name, description, price, quantity, image)

### 2\. Sales Mechanism

-   Purchase items directly through the contract
-   Built-in platform fee system
-   Escrow functionality to protect both buyers and sellers
-   Quantity tracking for each item

### 3\. Dispute Resolution System

-   7-day window for opening disputes
-   Owner-mediated dispute resolution
-   Ability to refund or release funds based on dispute outcome

### 4\. Security Measures

-   Role-based access control
-   Seller verification for item modifications
-   Quantity and pricing validation

Contract Components
-------------------

### Data Variables

-   `owner`: Contract owner principal
-   `next-item-id`: Incremental ID for new items
-   `next-sale-id`: Incremental ID for sales
-   `platform-fee-percentage`: Configurable platform fee

### Core Maps

-   `items`: Stores detailed item information
-   `sales`: Tracks individual sale transactions
-   `escrow`: Manages fund holding and release
-   `seller-ratings`: Potential future reputation system
-   `disputes`: Handles transaction disputes

Usage Workflow
--------------

### Adding an Item

1.  Call `add-item` with:
    -   Item name
    -   Description
    -   Price
    -   Category
    -   Image URL
    -   Quantity

### Purchasing an Item

1.  Call `buy-item` with the item ID
2.  Contract automatically:
    -   Transfers funds
    -   Calculates platform fee
    -   Updates item quantity
    -   Creates sale and escrow records

### Dispute Resolution

1.  Buyer can `open-dispute` within 7 days of purchase
2.  Contract owner resolves dispute via `resolve-dispute`
3.  Can refund buyer or release funds to seller

Error Codes
-----------

-   `u100`: Unauthorized action
-   `u101`: Item not found
-   `u102`: Item unavailable
-   `u200`: Invalid quantity
-   `u400-u406`: Dispute and resolution errors

Security Considerations
-----------------------

-   Owner-only dispute resolution
-   Explicit permission checks
-   Escrow mechanism protects transaction funds
-   Quantity and pricing validations

Potential Improvements
----------------------

-   Implement full seller rating system
-   Add more granular dispute resolution
-   Support for multiple payment tokens
-   Enhanced metadata and category management
